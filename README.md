# Sales Performance Dashboard (Power Query + SQL + Power BI)

This project analyzes sales performance across regions, categories, products, salespeople, and time.  
I used **Power Query for data cleaning**, **SQL for analysis**, and **Power BI for interactive visualisation**,**DAX including a **measure selector** to switch between monthly trends for Sales, Boxes, Shipments, Profit, and Total Cost.
